He was so stinky that he wouldn\u2019t e=ven give a stale crumb to the birds. His neighbor, on the other hand, was a kind man who was always glad to share the little he had. He cared more about making friends than he did about making money. The greedy baker was jealous of his cheerful neighbor. He grumbled, \u201cHow can he have so little and yet be so happy?\u201d Every morning, the smell of cinnamon buns and sweet rolls drifted out of the bakery. The wind carried the wonderful aroma toward the neighbor\u2019s house. As the poor neighbor sat on his porch eating stale bread, the sweet smell filled the air. He took a deep breath and sighed with happiness. As the baker watched, he thought, \u201cThe smell from my baked goods makes his stale bread taste delicious. That\u2019s not fair. He should have to pay for such pleasure.\u201d After seeing this happen, again and again, the baker went to his neighbor\u2019s house and handed him a bill. \u201cYou want me to pay you? For what? I don\u2019t have enough money to buy anything in your store,\u201d said the kind neighbor. \u201cThat\u2019s right! You pay nothing and yet every day you steal the smell of my baked goods,\u201d yelled the baker. \u201cYou mean you want me to pay ten coins as a smelling fee?\u201d laughed the neighbor. \u201cYes! From now on, I\u2019ll not be cheated and if you don\u2019t pay, I\u2019ll take you to the court,\u201d replied the baker. When word of the baker\u2019s demand spread around the city, everyone laughed at the idea of a stolen smell. \u201cThat\u2019s right! You pay nothing and yet every day you steal the smell of my baked goods,\u201d yelled the baker. \u201cYou mean you want me to pay ten coins as a smelling fee?\u201d laughed the neighbor. \u201cYes! From now on, I\u2019ll not be cheated and if you don\u2019t pay, I\u2019ll take you to the court,\u201d replied the baker. When word of the baker\u2019s demand spread around the city, everyone laughed at the idea of a stolen smell. \u201cThat\u2019s right! You pay nothing and yet every day you steal the smell of my baked goods,\u201d yelled the baker. \u201cYou mean you want me to pay ten coins as a smelling fee?\u201d laughed the neighbor. \u201cYes! From now on, I\u2019ll not be cheated and if you don\u2019t pay, I\u2019ll take you to the court,\u201d replied the baker. When word of the baker\u2019s demand spread around the city, everyone laughed at the idea of a stolen smell. The next day, the baker and the neighbor arrived at the crowded court. Many townspeople were puzzled by the judge\u2019s actions and came to see what the judge would do. They could not believe that he might make the kind man paying for a smell. When the judge walked in, the courtroom fell silent. First, he listened to the baker\u2019s complaint. Then, he turned to the neighbor and asked, \u201cIs it true that you have enjoyed the smell of this man\u2019s baked goods every day for many years?\u201d \u201cYes, your honor! I must confess that is true,\u201d admitted the neighbor. The judge thought for a while. Finally, he declared, \u201cA smell has been stolen. Since stealing is a crime, the neighbor must be punished!\u201d The kind man protested, \u201cBut your honor\u2026\u201d \u201cOrder in the court,\u201d bellowed the judge. He then turned to the neighbor and demanded, \u201cTake the five gold pieces from your pocket!\u201d After the neighbor did so, the judge ordered, \u201cNow, drop the coins from one hand to the other!\u201d The neighbor passed the gold coins back and forth between his hands. The judge turned to the baker and asked, \u201cDid you hear the jingle of the gold coins?\u201d \u201cYes, I did!\u201d said the baker with a greedy grin. \u201cDid you like the sound?\u201d asked the judge. \u201cYes, it is a wonderful sound. It is the payment I believe I deserve,\u201d cried the baker. The baker began to move toward his neighbor to grab the money. \u201cWait!\u201d cried the judge. \u201cYou have already a fair payment. Your neighbor was guilty of stealing the smell of your baked goods. You have been paid by hearing the sound of his money. This case is dismissed,\u201d said the judge. Laughter filled the courtroom as the people marveled at the judge\u2019s cleverness. The baker hung his head. Even he saw how foolish and greedy he had been. From then on, the judge was known as the wisest of all, treating people fairly and honestly while also making sure everyone took full responsibility for their actions.","questions":[{"id":"01","questionText":"Where did the baker live?","answerOptions":[{"id":"1","answerText":"Paris, France","isCorrect":false},{"id":"2","answerText":"Lima, Peru","isCorrect":true},{"id":"3","answerText":"Buenos Aires, Argentina","isCorrect":false},{"id":"4","answerText":"Bogota, Colombia","isCorrect":false}]},{"id":"02","questionText":"What did the baker accuse the neighbor of stealing?","answerOptions":[{"id":"1","answerText":"Sweet Rolls","isCorrect":false},{"id":"2","answerText":"Large Birthday Cake","isCorrect":false},{"id":"3","answerText":"Ham and Cheese Sandwich","isCorrect":false},{"id":"4","answerText":"The Smell of his Baked Goods","isCorrect":true}]},{"id":"03","questionText":"How many gold pieces were in the neighbor\'s pocket?","answerOptions":[{"id":"1","answerText":"3","isCorrect":false},{"id":"2","answerText":"8","isCorrect":false},{"id":"3","answerText":"5","isCorrect":true},{"id":"4","answerText":"4","isCorrect":false}]},{"id":"04","questionText":"What was the payment the judge made the neighbor pay to the baker?","answerOptions":[{"id":"1","answerText":"5 Gold Pieces","isCorrect":false},{"id":"2","answerText":"The Sound of 5 Gold Pieces Moving Hands","isCorrect":true},{"id":"3","answerText":"4 Gold Pieces","isCorrect":false},{"id":"4","answerText":"The Smell of all his Money","isCorrect":false}]}]}}]')},20:function(e,t,s){},41:function(e,t,s){},42:function(e,t,s){},52:function(e,t,s){},53:function(e,t,s){"use strict";s.r(t);var a=s(0),n=s.n(a),r=s(33),i=s.n(r),o=(s(41),s(16)),c=(s(42),s(14)),h=s(21),d=s(6),l=s(15),u=s(8),j=s(11),b=s(29),g=s(1);var x=function(){var e=c[0].reading.title,t=c[0].reading.subtitle,s=c[0].reading.text;return Object(g.jsxs)("div",{children:[Object(g.jsx)("h1",{children:e}),Object(g.jsx)("h2",{children:Object(g.jsx)("i",{children:t})}),Object(g.jsx)("p",{children:s})]})},m=s(36),O=s(12);var f=function(e){var t=Object(a.useState)(0),s=Object(o.a)(t,2),n=s[0],r=s[1],i=c[0].reading.questions[n],h=i?i.answerOptions:null,l=n+1;function b(t){if(t.isCorrect){var s=function(e){e<0&&(e=0);return e+1}(e.userScore);e.setUserScore(s)}else e.setCorrectQuestions([].concat(Object(m.a)(e.correctQuestions),[i]));r(l)}return null!=h?Object(g.jsxs)(j.a,{children:[Object(g.jsx)(u.a,{md:1,lg:1,className:"text-center",children:Object(g.jsx)("h2",{children:i.questionText})}),Object(g.jsx)(u.a,{md:1,lg:1,className:"p-5",children:Object(g.jsxs)(O.a,{className:"height100",children:[Object(g.jsx)(O.a.Item,{id:"1",action:!0,onClick:function(){return b(h[0])},children:h[0].answerText}),Object(g.jsx)(O.a.Item,{id:"2",action:!0,onClick:function(){return b(h[1])},children:h[1].answerText}),Object(g.jsx)(O.a.Item,{id:"3",action:!0,onClick:function(){return b(h[2])},children:h[2].answerText}),Object(g.jsx)(O.a.Item,{id:"4",action:!0,onClick:function(){return b(h[3])},children:h[3].answerText})]})})]}):Object(g.jsx)(u.a,{children:Object(g.jsx)(d.a,{to:"/QuizScore"})})};s(32),s(20);var y=function(e){return Object(g.jsx)(l.a,{className:"quizpagepadding",children:Object(g.jsxs)(u.a,{children:[Object(g.jsx)(j.a,{className:"p-50",xs:5,children:Object(g.jsx)(b.a,{className:"reading",children:Object(g.jsx)(x,{})})}),Object(g.jsx)(j.a,{children:Object(g.jsx)(b.a,{children:Object(g.jsx)(f,{userScore:e.userScore,setUserScore:e.setUserScore,setCorrectQuestions:e.setCorrectQuestions,correctQuestions:e.correctQuestions})})})]})})},w=s(13),p=s(35);var k=function(e){return Object(g.jsx)(l.a,{className:"automargintb",children:Object(g.jsx)(u.a,{children:Object(g.jsx)(j.a,{children:Object(g.jsx)(w.a,{style:{width:"100%"},children:Object(g.jsxs)(w.a.Body,{children:[Object(g.jsx)(w.a.Title,{children:"Instructions"}),Object(g.jsx)(w.a.Text,{children:"This is a quiz to assess your ability to read a paragraph and answer questions.
